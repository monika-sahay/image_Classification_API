# image_Classification_API
This GitHub repository provides a step-by-step guide and code for deploying a Flask REST API using one of PyTorch's pre-trained computer vision image classification models. The API allows users to send an image to the server, which then uses the pre-trained model to predict the image's classification and returns the result.

# Project Overview
This project serves as an intermediate-level Python project, ideal for individuals interested in learning how to deploy PyTorch computer vision models as production-ready REST APIs. While building and training models are not covered in this project, it assumes prior knowledge of these concepts. Additionally, familiarity with Git, REST APIs, and the Python Flask module is required.

To get started, learners will need a AWS account and some understanding of the Postman API Platform. The provided code and instructions guide users through the process of deploying the API on Heroku, making it accessible to clients for image classification tasks.

#### Features
- Deploy a Flask REST API for image classification using a pre-trained PyTorch computer vision model.
- Utilize one of PyTorch's pre-trained computer vision models for image classification.
- Enable users to submit an image via the API and receive the predicted classification label.
- Provide step-by-step instructions for deploying the API on Heroku.
- Demonstrate how to test the API functionality using the Postman API Platform.
#### Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Flask
- Heroku account
- Postman API Platform
#### Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
3. Build a pipeline using Docker, jenkins, Gunicorn and github on aws.
4. Use Postman or any other API testing tool to send images to the deployed API for classification.
