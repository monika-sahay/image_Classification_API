# image_Classification_API
This GitHub repository provides a step-by-step guide and code for deploying a Flask REST API using one of PyTorch's pre-trained computer vision image classification models. The API allows users to send an image to the server, which then uses the pre-trained model to predict the image's classification and returns the result.
